# Lemonade installer made in python only for the Windows paltform

## How to build?

- Open a powershell terminal on the working direcotry
- Run build.ps1

# It's a virus?

**The installer being detected as a virus is just Windows being dumb , the installer is just a simple python app but it probably gets detected because it fetches and downloads the app from github**

Oh and also i aint signing it, it costs money brother
